## Project Description
An app for users to efficiently track their tasks at work to improve productivity and track value add of their work. Users log and track the status of weekly to-dos, follow-ups, unplanned asks, and accomplishments. Within these categories, users can also assign priorities and progress status to organize their work more efficiently, as well as the value add of their work to reflect on relevance, and for later reference to quantify their contributions at their workplace.
